# 1. Blacklist Setup

# Run the following command to get the "device" blacklist information for LXC Ubuntu host OS harddrive.

#     udevadm info -a -p  $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/sda)  | egrep 'ATTRS{rev}|ATTRS{model}|ATTRS{vendor}' | grep -v 0x

# Output of udevadm command for OS hard drive is shown below. Note that "spaces matter    ".

#       ATTRS{rev}=="SM30"                                                          <-- blacklist "revision"
#       ATTRS{model}=="ST1000LM014-1EJ1"                                            <-- blacklist "product"
#       ATTRS{vendor}=="ATA     "                                                   <-- blacklist "vendor"

# Run the following command to get the "device" blacklist information for the Wintec 128Gb Flash ExpressCard.

#    udevadm info -a -p  $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/sdag) | egrep 'ATTRS{rev}|ATTRS{model}|ATTRS{vendor}' | grep -v 0x

# Output of udevadm command for Wintec Flash Express Card is shown below. Note that "spaces matter    ".

#       ATTRS{rev}=="18  "                                                          <-- blacklist "revision"
#       ATTRS{model}=="Wintec JM612 128"                                            <-- blacklist "product"
#       ATTRS{vendor}=="ATA     "                                                   <-- blacklist "vendor"

# Run the following command to get the "wwid" blacklist information for your Ubuntu host hard drive.
#    sudo /lib/udev/scsi_id -g -u -d /dev/sda
# Output of scsi_id command for OS harddrive is shown below.

#      "35000c500828b9d7e"                                                          <-- blacklist "wwid"

# Output of scsi_id command for Wintec Flash Express Card is shown below.
#    sudo /lib/udev/scsi_id --whitelisted --device=/dev/sdag
# Output of scsi_id command for Wintec Flash Express Card is shown below. Note that "spaces matter    ".

#      "1ATA     Wintec JM612 128G ExpressCard SSD       WT612-128G2300000424"      <-- blacklist "wwid"

# Add the above blacklists below to blacklist these devices from multipath as shown below.
# Handle any other devices to be blacklisted using similar commands.
# Both devices are blacklisted using two methods: (1) by devices, and; (2) by wwid's.

# 2. Additional Devices Setup

# On the Lenovo W520 laptop being used here, for example, there is a Wintec JM612 128Gb Express Card flash device.
# http://www.wintecind.com/OEM/SSD/MicroSATA/JM612.html
# If there are external or plugin devices you can configure them in the multipath.conf also as shown below.
# Output of below udevadm command is shown below for the "Wintec JM612 128Gb Express Card".

#    udevadm info -a -p  $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/sdag) | egrep 'ATTRS{rev}|ATTRS{model}|ATTRS{vendor}' | grep -v 0x

#       ATTRS{rev}=="18  "                                                          <-- device "revision"
#       ATTRS{model}=="Wintec JM612 128"                                            <-- device "product"
#       ATTRS{vendor}=="ATA     "                                                   <-- device "vendor"

# Although Wintec Flash Express Card is blacklisted, it could be used as a multipath device, thus included as a device.

# 3. SCST_FIO

# Configure the SCST_FIO device as shown below using the stanza as shown.
# The SCST_FIO is the file device driver that is used for file-backed SCST LUNs.
# The file-backed SCST LUNs is used for the RAC LUNs in this project.

# 4. SCST_BIO

# Configure the SCST_BIO device as shown below using the stanza as shown.
# The SCST_BIO is the block device driver that is used for device-backed SCST LUNs.
# Device-backed devices are not used in the Oracle RAC project but they could be used alternatively.

# 5. WWID

# The WWID of the Oracle RAC SCST LUNs must be obtained for each LUN to be used and multipath.conf updated with wwid values.
# There are various commands which can be used.  Examples are shown below of ways to get the information needed.
# Note that on Ubuntu the command location is "/lib/udev/scsi_id" as shown below.
# All these commands show how the wwid values of the LUNs can be obtained. Note that all methods give the same result
# Output of the scsi_id command for SCST_FIO LUNS is shown below.

#    sudo /lib/udev/scsi_id --whitelisted --device=/dev/dm-4
# 23832373561623531
#    sudo /lib/udev/scsi_id -g -u -d /dev/mapper/asm_disk_lxc1_systemdg_01
# 23832373561623531
#    sudo /lib/udev/scsi_id --whitelisted --device=/dev/mapper/asm_disk_lxc1_systemdg_01
# 23832373561623531

# Once the LXC Linux container is configured the wwid can also be checked from the container as shown below.
# gstanden@vmem1:~/Networking$ ssh root@lxcora01
# Last login: Sun Aug  2 12:42:53 2015 from 10.207.39.1
# [root@lxcora01 ~]# scsi_id -g -u -d /dev/mapper/asm_disk_lxc1_systemdg_01
# 23832373561623531
# Once all the wwid and device friendly names are decided (being sure to put correctly sized LUNs with the desired devices) complete the "multipaths" section.
